# Design Lab

This is where I practice and build my skills in design, from foundational principles to advanced techniques.

Advanced projects are stored on Google Drive. [Advanced Skills](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iCY7bu1GlNoqRISAIboLfhgRixf2080R?usp=sharing)
<br>*I'm focusing on foundational skills for now, it's still empty.*
## Goal
- Build a solid foundation in design principles and to create a portfolio of design projects over time.
